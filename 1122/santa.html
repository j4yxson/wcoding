        // Santa is trying to deliver presents in a large apartment building, but he can't find the right floor - the directions he got are a little confusing. He starts on the ground floor (floor 0) and then follows the instructions one character at a time.

        // An opening parenthesis, (, means he should go up one floor, and a closing parenthesis, ), means he should go down one floor.

        // The apartment building is very tall, and the basement is very deep; he will never find the top or bottom floors.

        // For example:

        // (()) and ()() both result in floor 0.
        // ((( and (()(()( both result in floor 3.
        // ))((((( also results in floor 3.
        // ()) and ))( both result in floor -1 (the first basement level).
        // ))) and )())()) both result in floor -3.
        // To what floor do the instructions take Santa?


        // BONUS:
        // Now, given the same instructions, find the position of the first character that causes him to enter the basement (floor -1). The first character in the instructions has position 1, the second character has position 2, and so on.

        // For example:

        // ) causes him to enter the basement at character position 1.
        // ()()) causes him to enter the basement at character position 5.
        // What is the position of the character that causes Santa to first enter the basement?
