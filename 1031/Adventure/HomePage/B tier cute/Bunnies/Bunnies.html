    <p>
        This is a picture of a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottontail_rabbit">Cottontail
            Rabbit</a>. Not really sold on bunnies as <a href="../../morningexercise.html">pets</a>, but
        still cute enough I think. Maybe if you can't have a real pet, go for a rabbit.
